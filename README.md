[How to create your own Node.js module](https://initialcommit.com/blog/nodejs-module)

> ## 3\. Write your module
>
> There should now be a `package.json` file inside your project directory. We need to write our code to upload it as a module.
>
> **Note:** In this example, we are simply writing a function to print some text to the console.
>
> Create a file and name it `index.js` in the project directory. Copy and paste the following code to index.js:
>
>     exports.printMsg = function() {
>       console.log("Node.js is awesome!");
>     }
>
>
> ## 4\. Publish the module to NPM (Node Package Manager)
>
> If you don't have an npm account - Create one below:
>
> https://www.npmjs.com/signup
>
> Login using your credentials:
>
>     npm login
>
>
> After logging in, you're ready to publish!
>
>     npm publish
