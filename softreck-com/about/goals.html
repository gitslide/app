    <p>Software Engineer leadership is where you lead/manage a number of software engineers, directly or via another
        manager(s). Your title could be Engineering lead, Software Engineer manager, R&amp;D Manager, Director of
        Engineering or VP of Engineering or CTO.</p>


    <p>Your work will be split between four main areas: People, Process, Product and Technology. The higher you go the
        more your system design/architecture skills will matter and your coding less (unless you are in a small
        company).&nbsp; You will be wrangling with managing people, process, product whilst evolving the technical
        vision to fit all of your constraints. Hopefully you will be delegating and keeping a lot of things out of the
        way of your engineers, so that your engineers can code.</p>


    <p>In the end your short/medium term success will be determined by whether you can deliver the needs of product,
        keep your engineer team motivated and fully explain what is going on e.g. translating complex technical things
        into a language everyone can understand. Your long term success will be based in whether you made the right
        choice/balance between building out features vs platform and whether you upgraded your team in the right way –
        all why you helped the company stay in business.</p>


    <p>A layer of good, well-trained, and experienced managers makes a massive impact on allowing engineers to deliver
        on features and a solid platform, whilst growing those engineers to their full potential. A courageous leader
        will be copied, by others.</p>


    <p>This post is the first, of at least five more posts which will cover in depth People, Product, Process and
        Technology. For these topics I have provided a summary within this post. If Leadership specifically is of
        interest you can see some of my thoughts in the&nbsp;<a

    <p>In this post I will cover:</p>

    <p>In each section I have included Code-smells, patterns and anti-patterns to look for, I will keep adding
        throughout my career. Any engineer will know these are things to look for but do not always predicate a problem…
        Every organization will have anti-patterns and code-smells, identifying them helps you choose if that is the set
        of problems you want to work with or not.</p>

    <h1>Who leads who?</h1>


    <p>One of the first questions I ask in the interview, “<em>Is software engineering a servant to Product, or vice
        versa or is it a true partnership?</em>” This allows you to unpack who is leading who and understand the
        dynamics of this role.&nbsp;Really understanding the political make up will often tell you the type of job you
        will do as a software engineer leader within a organization.</p>


    <p>Sometimes you will find the culture is dominated by Sales especially in business to business (Hint – This can
        lead to a big divide &nbsp;between release dates and expected date by clients).</p>


    <p><em>Patterns to look for</em>:</p>


    <ol>
        <li>A partnership between Product, Design and Engineering</li>
        <li>Tech Debt is understood including how it is created</li>
        <li>Platform engineering is understood</li>
        <li>Data is valued and its engineering is invested in</li>
    </ol>


    <p><em>Anti-patterns and Codesmells to look for:</em></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Engineering tells Product what to do -&gt; The end product may miss the human factor, may not truly
            understand the customer, a lot of other departments will be frustrated – do not undervalue the importance of
            good Product People.
        </li>
        <li>Product tells Engineering how to do -&gt; This often leads to a <a
                href="https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2">feature
            factory </a>and under investment in your platform, leading to much bigger rebuilds to scale well. Retainment
            will be tough amongst engineering.
        </li>
        <li>Sales sells things that we have not built, designed or have the capacity to build. If It is common for Sales
            to oversell their products, you are creating an awful environment for both your Customer and Engineering
            people.
        </li>
        <li>For Startups -&gt; Is there a lot of “Playing Favorites” amongst the first tribe of people -&gt; Leads to
            all new people feeling undervalued and retainment is tough.
        </li>
        <li>There are no leaders with courage e.g. decisions are put off -&gt; leave get another job or teach them how
        </li>
        <li>You have no data specialists -&gt; without reliable data you do not know what is truly going on and you will
            not provide good analytics/reporting or have a hope to use Machine learning
        </li>
        <li>You have no single source of truth for your data -&gt; if you cannot trust reality and you have to guess, I
            hope you have some very lucky people -&gt; Fix this!
        </li>
        <li>A lack of trust in the engineers -&gt; “hand on leadership” -&gt; micromanages, still codes, does not pay
            enough attention to their people and their potential
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Founding Culture</h1>


    <p>I am going to assume that you have established product/market fit. As before that point the relationships and
        problems are very different. (Thanks <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glougheed/"
                                                target="_blank">Glen</a>&nbsp;for the reminder) – lots of experiments by
        Product to figure out the business.</p>


    <p>The next area I focus on is how respected/trusted technology is within the organization.</p>


    <p>One of the strongest influences is whether there was a technologist within the founding team and whether they are
        still with the business. If not, you have a lot more work to do. If it is a Startup, also knowing if one or all
        of the founding members has made a full transition to the C-Suite or not (they may have the title), this is easy
        to tell by the decisions they get involved in e.g. they are still coding, the button should be blue, you should
        hire an engineer not a DBA…</p>


    <p><em>Anti-patterns and CodeSmells to look for:</em></p>


    <ul>
        <li>The Founder/CEO decides what roles you hire for e.g. Full Stack Engineer vs DBA. Expect challenge, this is
            good, but if you have an agreed-upon budget and you are within it, then the actual Engineering Leadership
            should be able to choose how to solve their problems
        </li>
        <li>“<em>Over</em>” involvement from Founders/CEO in Product Design, everyone may have opinions, but you should
            trust the designers/POs/PMs or hire better ones and let them do their job
        </li>
        <li>Product is not talking to customers or sharing designs</li>
        <li>You are waiting until everything is “perfect” before release e.g. Waterfall rather than Agile</li>
        <li>There is a lot of opinion and there is no A/B testing with customers</li>
        <li>Sales and Product complain that engineering can never deliver on-time i.e. blame culture or worse it’s
            true.
        </li>
        <li>Choices are always made from data, i.e. the past -&gt; may show lack of risk/innovation</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Levels of Engineering Leadership</h1>


    <p>Below are some of the common leadership positions within Software Engineering, not every organization will have
        them all and what you do in each role will vary massively on the size of the organization and how many engineers
        you have.</p>


    <h3>Technical(Tech) Lead Role</h3>


    <p>Sometimes the leader will be the “technical lead” and sometimes not.&nbsp;If you want self organized teams the
        Tech lead should <strong>NOT</strong> be a position but instead an opportunity for all team members and should
        be based on a project or an epic. A great tech lead is a good influencer, educator and ensures that others in
        the team get to be heard and their ideas explored. A Bad Tech lead tells the software engineers all the time how
        they will Architect/design each feature e.g. micromanagement.</p>


    <p>A great tech lead will share, and keep sharing domain expertise around the team. This will help engineers grow
        and it will also not be so painful when an engineer leaves with ALL the domain knowledge for ALL the areas.
        Leading an area/domain will also allow a person to start thinking bigger e.g. have the opportunity to consider
        the strategic implications for their domain rather than just tactical feature additions.</p>


    <h3>Engineering Lead/Team Lead</h3>


    <p>Usually manages a couple of people (2-5). This position tends to only exist in Command &amp;
        Control/hierarchal/authoritarian structures and not in organizations that are flat or have <a
                href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/january/self-organizing-teams-what-and-how"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self organizing teams</a>. Their work may be split between the
        following:</p>


    <p><strong>Technical (approx 60%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Coding/code reviews (40% to 60%)</li>
        <li>System Design/Architecture (10% to 30%)</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>People (approx 20%)&nbsp;</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Coaching team members (5% to 20%) e.g. one to one meetings and in the moment coaching, higher for more
            junior team
        </li>
        <li>Team Building (0% to 10%) e.g. creating bonds, building resilience</li>
        <li>On-Boarding (0% to 10%)</li>
        <li>Administration (10% to 15%) e.g. performance reviews, recruitment, other HR/Finance needs</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Processes (approx 20%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Team Processes e.g. Agile (10% to 30%) e.g. standup, grooming, technical grooming, planning, Retros, sprint
            review
        </li>
        <li>DevOps/Operations/Fires (0% to 50%)</li>
        <li>Managing Up (0% to 10%)</li>
        <li>Inter team alignment (0% to 10%) e.g. Platform, Security, API, Mobile etc</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Product&nbsp;(approx 0%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Product conversations (0% to 20%)</li>
        <li>Product Design (0% to 10%)</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Realistically this is the last level that you will spend a lot of time coding unless you are in an early stage
        startup. If you are lucky and you have a good manager above you this may be still be possible. If you are in a
        specialized team and the only one of its type e.g. Mobile, Security or Data – its is likely you will have a lot
        more work in terms of educating, championing for that specialization e.g. presentations, coaching engineers,
        etc.</p>


    <p>Whilst some organizations call a position Engineer Manager, when they says “Hands on Engineering manager” I would
        say they are looking for the Eng Lead role, and they optimistically hope you can manage a bunch of engineers and
        code. Shopify has this role, I would also say Facebook Eng Manager role is more technical than people orientated
        and thus fits here.</p>


    <h3>Engineering Manager</h3>


    <p>Likely has between 4 and 12 engineers who report to them in one team. Science shows that the sweet spot is
        between 3 to 9 engineers. In some cases each team will have a Tech Lead or a Team Lead who reports into you the
        Manager. Younger organizations may give you multiple teams, which will likely stop your time coding. Team health
        will be one of your priorities at this level.&nbsp;</p>


    <p>An important foundation of engineering management is to be removing a lot of people/process/bureaucracy out of
        the way of engineers so that they can spend more time with code.&nbsp;If your head is down coding there are a
        lot of things you are likely missing.</p>


    <p><strong>Building a career path</strong> for each of your engineers is very important to help them grow. This will
        be a few minutes here there and everywhere. “Who should go on this new team” conversations, to sharing the work
        or they way they work with colleagues and others. You need to be a champion for each of your engineers and those
        moments will sometime be opportunistic and others carefully planned. The getting the actual ready for that
        moment is covered under the coaching and creating a career plan. Ensuring each of your engineers has purpose,
        autonomy and growing mastery is the set of keys to their and your success.</p>


    <p>Your time will be split all over the place and you must be good at context switching to survive this role.</p>


    <p><strong>Technical (approx 20%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Coding/code reviews (0% to 60%)</li>
        <li>System Design/Architecture (0% to 20%)</li>
        <li>Technology Strategy (0% to 20%)</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>People (approx 20%)</strong></p>

        <li>Recruitment (0% to 50%)</li>
        <li>Administration (10% to 30%)</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Product (approx 10%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Product Delivery &amp; Development (10% to 30%)</li>
        <li>Product Design (0% to 10%)</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Processes (approx 50%)</strong></p>


    <ul>
        <li>Team Processes e.g. Agile (10% to 30%)</li>
        <li>Documentation (10% to 20%)</li>
        <li>DevOps/Operations/Fires (0% to 50%)</li>
        <li>Building processes/policies/systems (10% to 30%)</li>
        <li>Managing Up/Reporting Up or Internal Presentations (0% to 20%)</li>
        <li>Engineering Leadership Alignment (10% to 30%)</li>
        <li>Inter team alignment (10% to 20%) e.g. Platform, Security, API, Mobile etc</li>
    </ul>


    <p><em>Exception</em> -&gt; You lead a research team (The R in the R&amp;D) or a Mobile team in a web company. You
        will have to do a lot of championing, advocating and explaining your tech to others.</p>


    <h4>Areas to focus on</h4>


    <ul>
        <li>Delivery of commitments e.g. features/stories, etc</li>
        <li>Team Health</li>
        <li>Reduce unnecessary process</li>
        <li>Ensure shared understanding with team and product</li>
        <li>Career paths for each of your engineers</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Director of Engineering</h3>


    <p>Often you are managing managers. You will likely be involved in some level of architecture of system design, but
        only to understand when big choices are being made. You will be responsible for creating/building
        processes/policies/systems e.g. interview process or career ladder for all engineer types for the whole
        department. You are likely to have some budget to control.&nbsp; You may also manage senior technical people who
        are in charge of domains of engineering e.g. Front End, Test, Platform etc.</p>


    <p>At this level you may also start been concerned with what does your platform look like in 2 to 3 years. For
        example you may want to move beyond a monolith to services based architecture. Thus you will have to work with
        product to take the big picture perspective and not just worry about how many features can you ram into the
        monolith.</p>

        <li>External Representation (0% to 20%) e.g. conferences, talks, etc</li>
    </ul>


    <p><em>Exception</em> -&gt; If you have people above you within Engineering (e.g. Product or Founder background) who
        do not have engineering experience your time explaining what you are doing and why will increase, a lot.</p>

    <h3>Vice-President of Engineering</h3>


    <p>The VP Engineering is all about recruiting, management, internal communication and delivery — getting the product
        out the door, while ensuring the team is delivering the agreed roadmap. You are often managing managers and
        directors. A wide perspective on how your technology works and Leadership development will be core in this role.
        Your focus will often be split between internal and external e.g. staff vs vendors. And your work day will be
        split between high-level direction/strategy, choosing between technologies, long-term technical and product
        strategy, working with legal department/people on technical matters, signing of partnerships with vendors, and
        evolving the engineering culture you want/need.</p>

    </ul>


    <p>You take the base % of each category you may notice its above 100%, yes you will find you miss the days of 9 to
        5, to keep up you will need extra hours to have the information you need or have great people who can support
        you.</p>


    <h4>Areas to focus on</h4>


    <ul>
        <li>Budget</li>

        <li>Ensure shared understanding with team and product</li>
        <li>Career paths for each of your Managers</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Time to think strategically</h4>


    <p>This role can also be dramatically different if there is no CTO. Note the senior leadership capacity (number of
        people) for each department, it will often show the balance of influence of each department e.g. if there is a
        VP of Eng, but CMO + VP Marketing and directors. Marketing will have more edge, as the CMO has more time to
        think through things versus the VP of Eng who may be “running the department” and have less strategic thinking
        time.</p>


    <h4>VP Engineering Patterns and AntiPatterns</h4>


    <p>The success will depend as much on the CTO and as the team. A great partnership with the CTO is essential. These
        could impact at every level below:</p>


    <p><strong>Homegrown CTO or Technical Founder</strong> – That will not let go That is still coding or “advising” on
        features and code that they built. This can help in organizations that the person above does not “know”
        technology or there are no board members who come from a Technology background. They will only employ “hand-on”
        people as they have not learnt how to grow others, and/or trust other engineers.</p>


    <p><strong>External only focused CTO </strong>– They sen a lot of time winning awards, helping the community at
        conferences. They do not focus on the C-Suite or understand what is going on in their department. </p>

            Engineering do, again?</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</h3>


    <p>Most of your time will be spent with you primary team e.g. C Suite or as the external face to the company. You
        will be a professional in translating and communicating technical issues in a language everyone can understand.
        You will be helping the organization define the balance between new feature development vs. Tech Debt. You may
        also do a level of Product depending who owns Product at the C-Suite level. You will also be driving business
        strategy and revenue through identifying and implementing new technologies. You know where is the world going in
        technology (competition/partners/industry. You will be often looking after the Board, you may be forming
        strategic technical partnerships. Or you maybe the chief architect. The interplay between this role and a VP of
        Engineering will often working in partnership.</p>


    <h3>Chief Information Officer (CIO)</h3>


    <p>Sometimes this role will be part of the CTOs role. CIOs work on setting strategy and direction to manage the
        company’s internal infrastructure and technical operations. That can include employee software
        applications/tools, internal communication (e.g. wiki, IM), technical infrastructure (e.g. wifi), process
        control, access control, employee network, cost management, integration of technologies across departments.</p>


    <p>Splitting Tech between CTO and CIO can create some very “interesting” dynamics, often creating many extra
        problems at the ground level within DevOps, perceived (sometimes real) boundaries e.g. who is responsible for
        this (“Throwing over the Wall”)or within movement of engineers from one role to another.</p>


    <h2>Engineering Leadership</h2>


    <p>Some companies think they can get by with no real management. They rely on Tech Leads (who are given no effective
        training or support), ignore engineering management and the next title is a Director, VP or CTO. They often do
        not train/coach/mentor their engineers to their potential. Thus there will be little coaching on
        communication/people skills if they are weak, and engineers often ask about their next career steps, some will
        find it easier to get “their” promotion by leaving. The lack of growth in communication/people skills has
        massive impact on the culture of the organization of engineering. In addition, learning to coach/mentor/teach is
        a set of skills that can take a while to learn fully. Sometimes this will be dismissed as “Soft Skills” –
        Presentations, Empathy, Feedback, Influence are all skills that will determine your success as a business and
        thus in my book are “Hard Skills” and all can be taught/coached. For those that feel they can avoid these skills
        by taking the Technical pathway, have yet to try to convince engineers, in multiple teams, to change what they
        are doing..</p>


    <h3>“Hands-on”</h3>


    <p>or are you technical is a term that is thrown around without understanding. It can show that the organisation
        needs technical leadership, it can also show there is no trust in the engineers, which also show no
        “growing”/coaching/mentoring exists or many other things. This is a debate that exists with technology that will
        never go aways because it is the attempt to understand the balance between your technology skills vs people
        skills. It is also overlapped with the bigger conversation between specialist and generalist and what they both
        mean. I also wonder if it leads to Ageism that we see in the tech sector. </p>


    <p><em>Anti-Patterns and CodeSmells in management/leaders of Engineers</em></p>


    <ol>
        <li>Someone who is in an engineering leadership position without ever been an engineer</li>
        <li>There is a blame or fear culture</li>
        <li>The engineer leader has never received any training or quality coaching</li>
        <li>Engineers are only valued based on the code they produce</li>
        <li>All engineers are full-stack engineers</li>
        <li>No Career Ladder for Software Leadership</li>
        <li>No internal promotions to senior leadership roles</li>
        <li>Too many internal promotions</li>
        <li>Your CTO or VP (not a tech co-founder) is writing code</li>
        <li>The CTO and VP Engineering are not aligned</li>
        <li>There is no CTO or no VP Engineering</li>
        <li>Anyone making engineering decisions when they were never an engineer</li>
        <li>No Engineer Managers for companies with over 30 Engineers</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>Areas of responsibility</h1>


    <p>There are four areas of responsibility that exist throughout all software engineer leadership. How much of each
        you will have to manage, will vary by company, culture and role. I will give a summary below and I am writing a
        separate blog or two on each area. The four areas to manage are P4T:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>People</li>
        <li>Process</li>
        <li>Product</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Bring consistency to delivery, find bottlenecks and remove them, keep evolving the processes</em></p>


    <p>How do you organize people to be productive, keep getting better and produce high quality work? Effective
        processes will help your teams do their jobs with less confusion (and more shared understanding), faster
        on-boarding and a clear north in moments of chaos. Processes can also introduce a fairer approach. That said,
        effective processes need to evolve/change and they should be versioned. &nbsp;They will sometimes get in the
        way, and maybe they should and maybe they should not. That’s where management decides.</p>

    <h2>The balancing of People, Process, Product and Tech</h2>


    <p>The order of importance of each of these areas depends on the culture, people and things you need to
        fix/upgrade/patch. Often if one is under-performing then the others will hurt as well. If you processes are
        weak, then knowledge is likely to reside in a few people who will leave (because they are overworked), which
        will be a hard hit for the organization and remaining people. If Technology is weak then your platform is likely
        to go down often, you could lose data, and it can be hard to add extra features. If your people are not invested
        in, or worse you hire the wrong people, they will leave. And finally if your product is not understood, your
        customers leave and no one has a job.</p>


    <p>Whilst I have focused this blog on Engineering management, do not be mistaken that I do not fully value a
        technical career pathway. It is essential for allowing full growth of the majority of engineers, a healthy
        codebase and timely product release.</p>

    <h1>Why am I a Software Engineer Leader?</h1>


    <ul>
        <li>I love helping people reach their potential</li>
        <li>I love technology and ensuring it is doing the right thing</li>
        <li>I love solving problems with other problem solvers whether they be engineers, product, designers or
            customers
        </li>
        <li>I love the creation of a hypothesis and figuring out if it is true, and if not toss it away and move to the
            next
        </li>
        <li>Understanding complexity to a level that you can explain it to anyone</li>
        <li>Looking around corners and guessing what the future options are</li>
        <li>Growing people to be better problem solvers, able to drop ego and traverse through multiple science
            experiments and be good people to work with
        </li>
        <li>Solving tough problems that hopefully help people</li>
    </ul>
